<h2>About Merci</h2>
<!--Used Article to put in a larger body of text to mimic a blog. Learned that I still have to put <p> in there to break up and not be a whole runon paragraph-->

   <p>I graduated with a graphic design degree and have worked in the healthcare administration field for many years. 
    I enjoy working with a team of people and have shown to be a great motivator to my teams. </p> 
   <p>Art has always been a passion of mine and enjoy printed design even though this world is moving towards more on-screen work, I like to also admire tactile designs. </p>
